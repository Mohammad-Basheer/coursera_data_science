Hello and good day!

Below are the descriptions for the included files and analysis steps. 

File List and Descriptions:
1) README.md -> contains descriptions of folder contents and analysis steps. 
2) run_analysis.R -> script for data analysis. ***
3) OutputFiles -> folder for analysis output. ***
4) CodeBook.txt -> contains column mappings of the tidy data and the feature list.
5) step4_clean_data.csv <- example output for step4 data.
6) step5_clean_data.csv <- output files for step5. Separate tables for each subject.

*** Files with roles in analysis.

Steps for Analysis:
1) Unzip the UCI HAR Dataset into where you downloaded the files.
2) Replace the value of project_dir in the analyse_data.r script to the path where you downloaded the files (e.g. /home/user1/Desktop/DataScience/).
3) Run run_analysis.r through RStudio or Rscript. 
4) Check OutputFiles folder for output. (step4_clean_data for Step 4 sample output and step5_clean_data for Step 5 tidy data).
