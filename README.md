Hello and good day!

Below are the descriptions for the included files and analysis steps. 

File List and Descriptions:
1) README.md -> contains descriptions of folder contents and analysis steps. 
2) analyse_data.r -> script for data analysis. ***
3) DataFolder -> folder containing the data files to be analysed. *** 
4) OutputFiles -> folder for analysis output. ***
5) CodeBook.txt -> contains column mappings of the tidy data and the feature list.
6) step4_clean_data.txt <- example output for step4 data.
7) subject_n.txt <- output files for step5. Separate tables for each subject.

*** Files with roles in analysis.

Steps for Analysis:
1) Unzip the UCI HAR Dataset into DataFolder (resulting path should be: /DataFolder/UCI HAR Dataset/<files_under_uci_har>)
2) Replace the value of project_dir in the analyse_data.r script to the path where you downloaded the files (e.g. /home/user1/Desktop/DataScience/).
3) Run analyse_data.r through RStudio or Rscript. This may take a while.
4) Check OutputFiles folder for output. (step4_clean_data for Step 4 sample output and sample_n.txt for step 5 tidy data).
